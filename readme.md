Inspired by recent racial justice events in the world and on campus, the ELPS Interdisciplinary Undergraduate research team sought to provide a fully comprehensive gaming experience to improve the empathetic response of students, particularly those participating in the Leadership Minor at UTK. Through intensive analysis of a large collection of primary source original interviews, conference speeches, and images, the historical research team found the most vital pieces of information for understanding the racial justice movement in 1960 in the historically black Alabama State College in Montgomery, Alabama. Following this, the design team created a prototype experience for three different student archetypes: the Student Leader, the Activist, and the Academically Focused Student. The design team looked at games which had, often unintentionally, provided empathetic responses similar to those we sought to provide, games with mechanics that lend themselves particularly well to historical information, games that allowed for player interpretation and play style malleability, and games that students were particularly interested in. The design team created databases for these various game components and isolated those which were thought to best synergize. This designer examined the predicted playstyles and interests of the Academically Focused student: this archetype would be unlikely to seek extracurricular activities but motivated by assignments, less active in Greek Life or other Student Life activities but interested in Honors Societies and Assistantships, and less likely to go to a popular restaurant nearby than the campus library. The design team then generated example interactions and a proposed timeline for the game.
